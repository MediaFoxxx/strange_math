# strange_math
Strange math. Its main difference from ordinary mathematics is that the numbers in it are ordered not in ascending order, but lexicographically, that is, as in a dictionary (first by the first digit, then, if the first digit is equal, by the second, and so on). In addition, we are not considering an infinite set of natural numbers, but only the first n numbers. So, for example, if n=11, then the numbers in strange mathematics are ordered as follows: 1, 10, 11, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9. This is a program that, given n, finds the place of a given number k in the order defined in strange mathematics. For example, if n=11 and k=2, the program should give 4 as the answer.
